# 7012-contracts
Experimental contracts for IEEE P7012 based on ODRL and DPV

## Summary of modelled contracts

**To be added**


## Additional context for ODRL contracts

- Individuals' policies are modelled as `odrl:Set` since they represent the conditions of data use that any recipients of the policy must adhere to be able to use said data
- Organisations/other individuals looking to use said data must issue an `odrl:Request` that matches the offer of the individual
- Once an agreement is settled, the conditions of the contract are consolidated in an `odrl:Agreement`
- This follows previous work done [here](https://content.iospress.com/articles/semantic-web/sw243583) and also aligns with the [formal semantics of ODRL](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/)
